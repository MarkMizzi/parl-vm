# ParL Virtual Machine

This is a playground for the ParL virtual machine implementation.

## Development

You can build and run the webapp for development using the following command:

```bash
npm run vite-dev
```

This starts the application, which can then be accessed in a browser on the same machine at the url http://localhost:5173. The application will be reloaded as you change your code.

## Building

You can build the web app by running

```bash
npm run build
```

However the playground is designed to be run inside a Docker container (see [here](../README.md)).
